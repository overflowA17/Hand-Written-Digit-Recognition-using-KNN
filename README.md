#Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-using-KNN

Using the superised machine learning algorithm, K Nearest Neighbor I have trained a model to recognize digits - {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}
I have created a tkinter based application to get a user based hadwritten digit run it through my model and predict which digit it is
